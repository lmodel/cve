# Security Policy

*This file is a policy, not a threat model. It says how to report, what executes here, and what holds each surface. Each is a line or two that links to where the reasoning lives: a workflow header, or the shared [threat model](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/knowledge-trust-ladder/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md). `lint-and-docs.yaml` holds the file to a word budget so it stays that way.*

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/lmodel/cve/security/advisories/new), not a public issue or a pull request. Say which file is affected, how it is exploitable, and whether it reaches the released schema or only this repository's automation. One person maintains this repository: expect a first reply in days, not hours, and no bounty.

## Supported versions

**Only the latest release receives fixes.** A security fix is released as a patch and noted in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The schema stays below 1.0 ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing-maintainers)).

## What this repository releases

It releases a LinkML schema and the Python datamodel generated from it. Nothing is published to PyPI. When the bundle or the schema has changed, `knowledge-release.yaml` attaches three assets to the release, each with its `.sha256` and a build-provenance attestation: the schema's `lokf adapt` copy, the knowledge bundle as a zip, and a Microsoft 365 Copilot skill zip. A schema is data: loading one from an untrusted source with any LinkML tool is that tool's risk, not this repository's.

`scripts/check_upstream_release.py` runs only in `upstream-watch.yaml`. It asks the GitHub API about the CVE Program's three repositories. It sends the workflow's token, which can write issues, to `api.github.com` alone, follows a redirect only over https to `api.github.com`, and writes nothing but its report. `scripts/fetch_cve_records.py` reads addresses from `tests/data/cvelist/manifest.json` only, on `raw.githubusercontent.com` only, and keeps a file only when its size and hashes match the manifest.

A CVE record is untrusted text from many publishers, and this repository treats it as data: tests validate records and nothing executes them. The schema describes a record's shape and says nothing about whether what a record claims is true.

## What executes here

| Surface | What holds it |
| --- | --- |
| `main.yaml` and `lint-and-docs.yaml` on every pull request, and `knowledge-registrar.yaml` on any that touches `.lokf/`: tests, linters and the bundle's form | Read-only jobs with `persist-credentials: false`; `uv sync --locked` installs only what `uv.lock` pins. |
| `semantic-release.yml`, which pushes a changelog commit and tag to `main` and dispatches the knowledge release | Runs only on a push to `main`, in the `release` Environment, installing its pinned tools with `--ignore-scripts`. [Repository hardening](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/knowledge-trust-ladder/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md#repository-hardening). |
| `knowledge-website.yaml`, which publishes the site to GitHub Pages | Builds without a write token; only its deploy job holds `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, and it runs only from `main`, once `KNOWLEDGE_WEBSITE_ENABLED` is `true`. |
| `upstream-watch.yaml`, weekly | Read-only checkout; the one write scope, `issues: write`, opens or updates the finding's issue. |
| `knowledge-librarian.yaml` and `.lokf/scripts/`, copies of the `ktl-sidecar` template, which run a large language model (LLM) agent on a schedule | The agent's job holds no write token. The `publish` job runs no agent, confines the patch to the bundle and refuses a `human:` claim, and a person merges the pull request. Inert until `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_ENABLED` is `true`. [Prompt-injection guards](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/knowledge-trust-ladder/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md#prompt-injection-guards). |
| `knowledge-release.yaml`, which attaches the schema copy and the bundle to a release | Inert until dispatched; only its `attach` job, which runs no third-party packages, can write. |
| `README.md`, `llms.txt` and the knowledge bundle, read by agents | Content, never instructions: each skill quotes what it did not author. A `human:` confirmation must be backed by a review or a signed commit. [Human attribution](https://github.com/noelmcloughlin/knowledge-trust-ladder/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md#human-attribution-human-is-a-claim-not-a-credential). |

Every workflow declares `permissions: {}` at the top, pins its actions to commit hashes that Dependabot keeps current, and runs harden-runner in audit mode. Three things are repository settings, not files. A ruleset on `main` blocks deletion and force-pushes and keeps the history linear. Two **are not yet in force here**: required reviewers on the `release` Environment, and secret scanning with push protection. Until they are, a qualifying merge releases with no human step. Nothing in continuous integration can assert them, so keeping them on is the maintainer's job.

## Not covered

- The CVE Record Format and the CVSS schemas: report a problem in the format to [its maintainers](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues). A vulnerability a record describes belongs with the publisher that the record names.
- LinkML, its generators and runtime: report them to [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/security).
- A compromised runner, upstream action or agent harness: this is a baseline, not a sandbox. Report a finding in one anyway, with scope and reproduction.
- Whether the knowledge bundle is *true*. The gate proves who vouched, not what they read. [AI_COVENANT.md](AI_COVENANT.md) sets the human-accountability rules.
